## Adjustable Claw

The [T.REX IWB Adjustable Claw](https://www.trex-arms.com/store/t-rex-iwb-adjustable-claw/) improves concealment for our inside-the-waistband Sidecar and Raptor holsters. It can be installed on the front or back of the holster, giving you a total of 21 different adjustment position combinations. This allows you to dial in the exact amount of grip tuck that you need for your body and pistol grip length. It can also be adjusted up or down to keep it flush with your beltline. This is especially useful when you are carrying at 4 oâ€™clock and tilting the gun forward for improved ergonomics.

More importantly, from an Open Souce Standpoint, is that this a modular part. The base component is a great host for other parts, and the interlocking teeth make a great interface. We are including a few different files that show claw styles with different shapes and textures, but the sky is the limit. You can build something that interfaces with the [Sidecar Spine System](https://github.com/trex-arms/sidecar), something truly revolutionary, or just a slightly different shape for your personal needs. 

Injected molded parts are available from the T.Rex site, but base component is the one that requires the most strength. Our tests have shown that they are pretty durable when printed out of nylon on an MJF or SLS printer, but the claw component takes less stress and can be printed using any technology.
